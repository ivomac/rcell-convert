# rcell-convert

This is part of an ETL pipeline based on Dagster constructed while working at the Blue Brain Project.

The `qpc` module converts raw patch-clamp data from a QPatch Compact (QPC) robot into *rCell* files, an in-house version of the .nwb (based on .h5) format. The `nwb` module provides tools to convert, validate, load and plot data on `rCells` from any robot source.

See the Readme files in the subdirectories for more information.
